                    For the longest of time, I've wanted to do something with software and music, even when I have zero knowledge about music and 
                    hold the guitar like I would hold a spoon. But what's fun in an activity that you already know, right? (blatant ignorance)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Music is fun, and it should be fun, at least for me. Which is why the name of the <em>entire</em> project is something right from
                    a meme-book (?) and the names of the two sub-apps are puns in themselves. Good luck figuring out what I came up with first - the names or the projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Because of my indecisiveness, there are two products right now, which thankfully didn't go up to three due to lack of time.
                    The first is the main app - a realtime music maker with audio recording and downloading and collabrative properties.
                    The second is a musical game, which um, does not involve any music. It's a guessing - something I remember playing with my brother <em>a lot</em> - only, instead of song titles, we did movie titles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I look forward to improving the apps to something less comic and more valuable in the future.
